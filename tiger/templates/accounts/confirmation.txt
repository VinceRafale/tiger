Hi {{ site.user.first_name }},

Thanks for signing up for Takeout Tiger!  We're sure that it will provide great new ways for you to expand your restaurant business through the power of the web.

You can log in to manage your site at {{ site.tiger_domain }}/dashboard/.   Your brand new site is currently accessible at {{ site.tiger_domain }}.  You will always be able to access your site at this address, even if you choose to add a custom domain (for example, http://www.{{ site.subdomain }}.com).

Your login for your dashboard is {{ site.user.email }}.  If you don't remember the password that you set when you signed up, you can reset it by going to {{ site.tiger_domain }}/dashboard/reset-password/.

Welcome to the Takeout Tiger family, and congrats on your new website!

Best wishes,
The friendly folks at Threadsafe Labs
